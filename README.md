# Simple Configurator

The Simple Configurator Add-On for Concrete CMS enables site owners to easily integrate a customizable multi-step form on their site. With the included "Configurator" block type, you can seamlessly embed the configurator into the frontend. Questions and steps are managed through the backend, allowing you to set up individual queries with specific prices and values. On the final step page, user information can be collected through customizable fields, which can be extended with attributes to suit your specific needs. This add-on is ideal for integrating multi-step forms to configure products or collect detailed information on your website.
